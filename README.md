#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the discipline that uses methods from computer sciences, mathematics, and engineering to design, maintain, and develop software applications used globally. It is the base of the world's communication. From software applications like Facebook, Reddit, Instagram, and WhatsApp, it is the main tool used for global news, currenty affairs, and communication. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1) The discovery of software engineering in 1968. The beggining of the software techonological revolution. As it was first recognised as its own separete discipline, it only grew in reputation from then on.
2) The introduction of the Waterfall model and the Agile methologies. In the 1970s and 1980s, we witnessed the rise in various software methologies that set to revolutionise the way software engineering was to continue in the mordern world. These frameworks offered organized strategies for overseeing software projects, enabling teams to more effectively plan, implement, and deliver software products.
3) The rise of Object-Oriented programming in the 1980s and 1990s set about yet another major revolution in the software engineering world. OOP concepts laid the ground work for programmers and software engineers alike to be able to be able to create more modular and reusable code. These concepts were called encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
4) The Emergence of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Models 1970s. These models provided a structured framework for planning, managing and excecuting practices for delivering software effectively and efficiently.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Plannig. In this stage, project goals are discussed anf defined and feasibility studies are conducted. Meetings with stakeholder are had to identify the parameters that the team has to work within.
Requirement Analysis. The requirements and expectations of both the users and the stakeholders are gathered. The team work to find a common ground of which expectations are feasable and which are not.
Testing. In this stage, the product that the team had worked on is being tested on to figure out if their work is up to par with the expectations of the users and stakeholders. And is seen if the product meets quality standards.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Model: Fixed requirements. At the beggining of the project, requirements are made and have to remain unchanged throughout the development process.
Agile Methologies: This model emphasizes on flexibility, enabling teams to addapt to changing requirements and incorporate feedback throughout the development process.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software deveeloper: Designing, developing, troubleshooting and debugging code. Quality assurance engineer: Testing, validating, process improvement, collaboration with stakeholders and risk assesment.
Project manager: Risk management, quality assurance, and stakeholder communication.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Code editing and syntax higlighting. This helps developers write code more efficiently and reduces the liklyhood of syntax errors. Debugging tools. This helps developers test their code and inspect variables in real-time and can find bugs quickly. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Keeping up with the technologies that change frequently. By dedicating time and energy to learn more and to be able to intergrate the work into the new technological era.
Managing tight deadlines. For this issue, effective time management id crucial for a final product that both works flawlesslly and is finished within the determined deadline.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is the testing of individual components to chekc if they work as inteded. Intergrated testing is the testing of different componenets to see if they can work together as intended. Sytem testing is the testing tests the complete application in an envirnoment that simulates the real world to see iif there are other components that are disfunctional that were missed. Acceptance testing is the testing where by the software is seen to meet the accpentance criteria set by stakeholders. It is the final test before it is released to the public.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
A prompt engineering is a set or words put in by the user to find information on a subject in which the AI tool might, not will, might be able to help in. The prompts vary from user to user as their needs are uniquely different from one another.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Water sanitation levels. This is an example of a vague prompt. It does not specify the location of the user, which level of contamination their water supply is or what the water would be used for. A better prompt would be as follows, What are the standards of water sanitation in the region of Naville for watering plants? This prompt is specific, the area, use of water and their local standards are specified and are likely to find a more informative solution along with a few links to their manicupal page and or library.
